10月初，日本护照获得缅甸免签后，日本公民现在可以在全球190个国家和地区享受免签或者落地签，将拥有189个免签和落地签目的地的新加坡挤到了第二名。
Germany, which began 2018 in the top spot, is now in third place with 188 destinations, tied with France and South Korea.

The United States and the UK, both with visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 186 destinations, are in fifth place. With neither having gained entry to any new jurisdictions this year, it seems unlikely that either will soon reclaim the No.1 spot they held in 2015.

"China and the UAE exemplify this kind of progress, with both states among the highest overall climbers compared to 2017, purely as a result of the strong relationships they have built with partner countries around the world."
“中国和阿联酋印证了这一进展，较2017年他们的名次上升幅度最大，这完全是因为这两个国家和他们在全球的伙伴国之间建立起的牢固关系。”
